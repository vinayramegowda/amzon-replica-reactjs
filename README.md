This project was designed to look very similar to amazon.com. it has been deployed on Firebase and here is a link to see a live demo of the application https://replica-vinay704.web.app/. The project is a Single page application (SPA) with BEM Naming conventions. It uses react router to route to different pages like login page, checkout page and home page. It is very well organized into different components whereeach component only works on a particular function so that it makes it easier to extend the application and also make the application loosely coupled. The login page uses Firebase authentication to authenticate or to add new login to the application. Please do havea look at my live demo (https://replica-vinay704.web.app/).
Thanks
